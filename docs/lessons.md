# Lessons Learned

The main point is that I managed to develop this project in a short time (3 to 4 days, about 2h a day), with a technology that I had never used before, and that I was able to learn a lot from this experience.

- **Willingness to learn**: I quickly realized that the key to learning any new technology is to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to learn. This is especially important when dealing with complex technologies like dotnet and C#.

- **Attention to detail**: I learned that attention to detail is crucial when programming in C# and working with dotnet project. One small mistake can cause the entire program to fail, so I had to pay close attention to syntax, formatting, and other details.

- **Persistence and problem-solving skills**: Learning a new technology can be challenging, but I found that persistence and problem-solving skills are essential to overcoming obstacles. Whenever I encountered a problem, I would research solutions and experiment with different approaches until I found a solution that worked.

- **Patience and practice**: I learned that it takes time and practice to become proficient in any programming language or technology. I had to be patient with myself and keep practicing until I became comfortable with dotnet and C#.

Overall, I believe that my experience learning dotnet and C# demonstrates my ability to quickly learn new technologies and apply my knowledge to real-world projects. I am excited about the opportunity to continue learning and contributing to your company as an intern.
